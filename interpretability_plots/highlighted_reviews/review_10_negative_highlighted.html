<html><body><p>THE PROTECTOR. You hear the name. You think, \ah, it's a <mark>crappy</mark> Hong Kong movie.\" <mark>Guess</mark> what - it's not Hong Kong. And <mark>yes</mark>, it is <mark>crappy</mark>. This amazingly stupid Jackie <mark>Chan</mark> film, ruined by us, <mark>yes</mark> us, the Americans (I'm boiling with anger, ooh, I think I'll jump out that window!), has <mark>Chan</mark> as a New York <mark>cop</mark> hunting down a <mark>gang</mark>, avenging the death of his buddy. Sounds cool...but it's not. Don't <mark>waste</mark> your money renting it. To prove he could <mark>make</mark> a <mark>better</mark> <mark>cop</mark> film, <mark>Chan</mark> <mark>made</mark> the amazing POLICE STORY (1985)."</p></body></html>
