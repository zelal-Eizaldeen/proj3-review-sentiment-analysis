<html><body><p>I really enjoyed this Minghella epic, thought not quite so much as \The <mark>English</mark> <mark>Patient</mark>\" (a modern-day classic). The first 20 <mark>minutes</mark> or so feel awkward, but as Inman (Jude <mark>Law</mark>) embarks on the journey <mark>back</mark> to his love Ava (<mark>Nicole</mark> Kidman), the film picks up in leaps and bounds and it <mark>becomes</mark> a very memorable, thoughtful romantic drama. Apparently it is fashionable to hate Kidman at the moment, but I don't agree at all, and she does well here. I actually think that the romance between Inman and Ada is weakly developed in the <mark>script</mark> (they really don;t get much <mark>screen</mark> time together to develop a relationship), but <mark>Law</mark> and Kidman give it their all and convince. Ada's journey is the crux of the film- she <mark>becomes</mark> a strong woman who can bear almost anything. Zellweger at first seems all wrong as Ruby, but she grows on you after all and sparkles in many of her later <mark>scenes</mark>. The film has beautiful photography and set design, but never really captures the true feel of a period piece. Jack White, in particular, has long straggly hair and a pale rocker's complexion that look completely out of place with the setting. Cillian Murphy fans will enjoying seeing the talented Irish actor in an early bit part, and Natalie Portman actually proves she can act in probably the film's most striking sequence. It's a pity that in \"The Other Boleyn Girl\" she's so inadequate."</p></body></html>
