<html><body><p>George Carlin is probably my favorite comedian. I have seen so many of his specials and even had the opportunity to see him perform live. He had a certain cynicism that always appealed to me. His last 2 specials (Life is Worth <mark>Losing</mark> <mark>especially</mark> and Complaints and Grievances) have <mark>lacked</mark> a certain spirit and content. George appeared overweight, <mark>old</mark> and tired (not to mention <mark>coming</mark> out of rehab). \I SAID NOT TO MENTION IT\"! Anyway. Life is Worth <mark>Losing</mark> was <mark>especially</mark> tragic as he was overweight, disgruntled, <mark>coming</mark> off of rehab (there we go again...) and extremely unfunny. If there was a way to feel sorry for a comedian without heckling him off stage, George achieved it with Life is Worth <mark>Losing</mark>. It is as if the New Millennium and Post 9/11 America was trampling George's spirit. The bs had become too large to manage.<br /><br />The comeback is partially successful with It's Bad for Ya! This <mark>special</mark> is the transmutation completed. George is no longer trying to rekindle his glory days. He is in full acceptance of his age, being <mark>old</mark> and dealing with the looming prospects of death. He has accepted being a crusty <mark>old</mark> SOB and is relishing in it. This is better than his <mark>previous</mark> specials, <mark>yet</mark> far from Jammin' in New York. It is a little tragic. His observations are not cutting edge anymore and seem more Andy Rooney than Lenny Bruce. George isn't George anymore. He is no longer criticizing us but is the <mark>man</mark> in the high castle pointing out how things were and how dissimilar modern life is. <br /><br />This is an improvement over the <mark>previous</mark> two specials, but George does not, as of <mark>yet</mark>, recoup his <mark>old</mark> glory (if ever). He has been reduced from critical social and political stinging commentary to mostly personal peeves. When he goes political, he still has something to <mark>say</mark>. It is heavily derived (<mark>especially</mark> if you have seen any of his <mark>previous</mark> work), but it still works somehow, as opposed to his random rantings which lack a certain relevance outside of the baby boom generation. The last 25 minutes is the best this <mark>special</mark> has to offer.<br /><br />For now I will worship the Sun and pray to Joe Pesci that George can recreate himself as a cutting edge septuagenarian. It's a 50/50 chance. Life seems to have become more tedious for George and his \"art\" is now his life. This is a step in the right direction from his <mark>previous</mark> 2 specials, but is far from his <mark>old</mark> self. Where does he go from here? He may never recoup but maybe he can further metamorphosing/refine this new ornery <mark>old</mark> <mark>man</mark> routine. Heres to hoping for 7 more words you can't <mark>say</mark> on TV or at least a windmill he can handle."</p></body></html>
