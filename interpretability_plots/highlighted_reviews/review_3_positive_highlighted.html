<html><body><p>this is what confuses me about critics and their opinion. i usually do take in, what the critics <mark>say</mark> about a film, on most occasions before i see a movie.<br /><br /><mark>however</mark>, i saw this one, without knowing anything about it. mainly because of the cast. kevin spacey and don cheadle are two of the most acclaimed and in my opinion best actors alive. and ryan gosling is on a fast escalating journey up there as well. his reality and humanity which he exudes in most of his portrayals, makes the <mark>audience</mark> truly believe in the character and whats happening to him.he's <mark>really</mark> my favourite actor of my generation. i've always found jena malone pretty cute,<mark>ever</mark> since donnie darko, and if she chooses to <mark>keep</mark> doing similar roles then heck i ain't complaining.<br /><br /><mark>back</mark> to my point. this movie <mark>really</mark> moved me. i believed it. the acting was <mark>top</mark> class. as one would expect. the actually movie left the <mark>audience</mark> with the ultimate aim of a <mark>good</mark> movie; reflection and pondering which ensues after the final credits roll. i think i must <mark>watch</mark> it again to decipher how this movie was critically mauled. i know that their reviews must be taken with a pinch of salt. at least i know now.</p></body></html>
