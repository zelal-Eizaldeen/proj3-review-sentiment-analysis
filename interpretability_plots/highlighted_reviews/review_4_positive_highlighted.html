<html><body><p>If you haven't seen the gong <mark>show</mark> <mark>TV</mark> series then you won't like this movie much at all, not that knowing the series makes this a great movie. <br /><br />I give it a 5 out of 10 because a few things <mark>make</mark> it kind of amusing that help <mark>make</mark> up for its obvious problems.<br /><br />1) It's a funny snapshot of the era it was <mark>made</mark> in, the <mark>late</mark> 1970's and early 1980's. 2) You get a lot of funny cameos of <mark>people</mark> you've seen on the <mark>show</mark>. 3) It's interesting to <mark>see</mark> <mark>Chuck</mark> (the host) when he isn't doing his on air <mark>TV</mark> personality. 4) You get to <mark>see</mark> a lot of bizarre <mark>people</mark> doing all sorts of weirdness just like you <mark>see</mark> on the <mark>TV</mark> <mark>show</mark>.<br /><br />I won't list all the bad things because there's a lot of them, but here's a few of the most prominent.<br /><br />1) The Gong <mark>show</mark> Movie has a lot of the actual <mark>TV</mark> <mark>show</mark> clips which gets tired at movie length. 2) The movie's story line outside of the clip segments is very weak and basically is <mark>made</mark> up of just one plot point. 3) <mark>Chuck</mark> is actually halfway decent as an actor, but most of the rest of the actors are doing typical way over the top 1970's flatness.<br /><br />It's a <mark>good</mark> movie to <mark>watch</mark> when you don't have an hour and a half you want to <mark>watch</mark> all at once. <mark>watch</mark> 20 minutes at a time and it's not so bad. But even then it's not so <mark>good</mark> either. ;)</p></body></html>
