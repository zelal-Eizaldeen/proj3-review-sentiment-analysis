<html><body><p>There no doubt in one mined that this movie is <mark>stupid</mark> and unfunny joke, but tell the <mark>truth</mark> it is quite entertaining (if you re first time viewer and try not to analyzed anything) Over all the movie have a very good ideas but badly written.<br /><br />The story of the two losers, waking up to <mark>find</mark> out that they can't remember what happen to them the day before. Only to <mark>find</mark> out later that they are after by the angry twin girl friends, aliens, transsexual stripper, Aliens nerds and some gangs members. <br /><br />Isn't it like The <mark>Bourne</mark> Identity? Yeah yeah, I know - how can I compare the two movies, but what the hell? They both have no memories; peoples were after them and so on. <br /><br />Anyway the movie is <mark>stupid</mark> and is only for the viewer that like <mark>stupid</mark> movie. <br /><br />Reason To Watch: · Loads of young talented actors, · Very <mark>stupid</mark> (after all you know it a <mark>stupid</mark> movie, why not make it extreme)<br /><br />Reason Not To: · If you like to analyzed, then forget it, · Talented Young actors turn <mark>bad</mark>, · Good plod turn <mark>really</mark> <mark>bad</mark><br /><br />Rating: 4/10 (Grade: E+)<br /><br />------------ ------------ ---------- ---------- --------- --------- ----<br /><br />'<mark>Dude</mark> Where's My Car' -wait, what do you expected from Ashton Kutcher's movie. I think almost every people got the same answer for this guy - 'A <mark>really</mark> <mark>stupid</mark> movie'. Apart from 'That 70s' Shows' this guy <mark>really</mark> has nothing to offer his fan. (He should thank the series for his reputation). '<mark>Dude</mark> Where's My Car', is one of his trademark -'stupidity'. Somehow his film is <mark>even</mark> <mark>worst</mark> than Adam Sandler's movies, (can you <mark>imagine</mark> that). The movie is <mark>really</mark> non-sense, no story line, and no nothing. Mara Sokoloff, Jennifer Garner, Alison Sweeney and S.W.Scoot should not have wasted their talent on this garbage. They <mark>even</mark> came up with 'Seriously, <mark>Dude</mark> Where's My Car'. This shows how the movie companies are dying of making money rather than quality.<br /><br />Max: 4/10<br /><br />Recommendation: Borrow it from your friends or just forget about it</p></body></html>
