<html><body><p>What is your freaking problem? Do you have nothing <mark>better</mark> to do than sit on your fat asses and blog about about how you <mark>find</mark> something in <mark>bad</mark> taste? Here's an idea:Go <mark>outside</mark>. That's right: Walk <mark>outside</mark> your <mark>mom</mark>'s basement that you've been living in for 13 years and GO <mark>outside</mark>. \But I can't leave! Star <mark>Trek</mark> is on in 30 minutes and I still haven't married that avatar on World Of Warcraft!\" Oh my God, in that <mark>case</mark>, stay inside! Alright, I might have gone overboard there. I mean, Star <mark>Trek</mark> is okay but I don't really <mark>watch</mark> it that much anymore. Either way, do you really have to write <mark>crap</mark> about Mind of Mencia. It's A <mark>GOOD</mark> SHOW. Maybe you're just venting your anger because that girl dumped you on World of Warcraft. Or you're constipated. Try putting fiber in your diet."</p></body></html>
