<html><body><p>This review contains spoilers.<br /><br />I was searching through horror movie DVDs on Amazon when I came across Flight Of The Living Dead. I <mark>already</mark> knew from the name that it was going to be abysmally naff and most probably a rip-off of Snakes On A <mark>plane</mark>, but it was selling brand new for 69p so I figured I didn't really have much to lose.<br /><br />The music played over the opening credits didn't fit at all, although I did like the <mark>song</mark> itself a pop-rock <mark>song</mark> isn't really suitable to appear on the soundtrack of a <mark>zombie</mark> horror movie. It started off surprisingly well, the opening scenes weren't too <mark>bad</mark>, some of the acting was a little cringe-worthy but not as <mark>bad</mark> as I initially thought it would be.<br /><br />It all goes well until Laura Cayouette (Rocket from Kill Bill: Vol. 2) enters the picture. She is supposed to be playing a scientist. If she is, she's not a very <mark>bright</mark> one. Luckily she's polished off pretty quickly.<br /><br />I actually physically laughed out loud when the camera panned over the passengers of the <mark>plane</mark> during some turbulence. There was a nun. Have you ever been on a <mark>plane</mark> with a nun!? I was surprised she wasn't clutching a crucifix.<br /><br />Finally, after 35 minutes, we get to some <mark>zombie</mark> action, and <mark>use</mark> the word 'action' loosely. The special effects are pretty below standard, but that's to be expected from a movie with this budget. Being covered in blood and having yellow contact lenses does not make you look like a <mark>zombie</mark> though, it makes you look pretty amusing. Using slow motion doesn't work particularly well either. I think this movie is probably guilty of trying to add too much story. Trying to pass off the problem as a variant of the \malaria virus\" wasn't an especially good move either considering malaria isn't a virus.<br /><br />The rest of the movie pretty much plays out like any other <mark>zombie</mark> movie. Most of the characters are killed off and it eventually ends up with a handful of <mark>people</mark> fighting to stay alive. Possibly the <mark>worst</mark> part of Flight Of The Living Dead is the utterly inconceivable <mark>ending</mark>. I know it's a movie about <mark>people</mark> who come back to life and feast on the living, but the <mark>ending</mark> was just ridiculous. Rating: ★★"</p></body></html>
