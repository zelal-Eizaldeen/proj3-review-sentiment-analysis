<html><body><p>Every once in a long while a movie will come along that will be so awful that I feel compelled to warn people. If I labor all my days and I can save but one soul from <mark>watching</mark> this movie, how great will be my joy.<br /><br />Where to begin my discussion of pain. For starters, there was a musical montage every five <mark>minutes</mark>. There was no <mark>character</mark> development. Every <mark>character</mark> was a <mark>stereotype</mark>. We had swearing guy, fat guy who eats donuts, goofy foreign guy, etc. The <mark>script</mark> felt as if it were being written as the movie was being shot. The <mark>production</mark> value was so incredibly low that it felt like I was <mark>watching</mark> a junior high video presentation. Have the directors, producers, etc. ever <mark>even</mark> seen a movie before? Halestorm is getting <mark>worse</mark> and <mark>worse</mark> with every new entry. The concept for this movie <mark>sounded</mark> so funny. How could you go wrong with Gary Coleman and a handful of somewhat legitimate actors. But trust me when I <mark>say</mark> this, things went wrong, VERY WRONG.</p></body></html>
