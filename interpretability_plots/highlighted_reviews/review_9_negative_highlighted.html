<html><body><p>I'm not going to <mark>waste</mark> my <mark>time</mark> writing an essay and <mark>waste</mark> your <mark>time</mark>. I would <mark>like</mark> to <mark>say</mark>, however, that all those who are uptight about this movie <mark>even</mark> being made are being totally ridiculous. Johnnymacbest, you can't play that <mark>card</mark>, and I mean the nationalism patriotic <mark>card</mark>, to make <mark>people</mark> not <mark>watch</mark> this movie. this is a movie that expresses its free will in this country (oh yea i played that <mark>card</mark>)<mark>even</mark> though the director is German and <mark>deserves</mark> a slap on the wrist every <mark>time</mark> he reaches for a camera, but the world is full of controversy, and its the same thing you've heard before, <mark>like</mark> the GTA controversy. It's a comedy, laugh and be disgusted, not disgusted all together, its dark humor and obviously you don't have the heart to take it, the past is past, yes <mark>people</mark> remember those who were lost but its <mark>time</mark> to move on, that was !!!7!!! years ago. You can still <mark>watch</mark> this movie and have good moral values. <br /><br /><mark>Besides</mark> I'm insane, and who needs a soul?</p></body></html>
